Download the 1,3 GB Zip (Labelled Data) from http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/egohands/ EgoHands Dataset.
Unzip it and rename the folder _LABELLED_SAMPLES into data
Run the train right in the level where the Mydataset.py and the folder data are.
It does run with os normpath so you don't have to worry about the operating system  of yours.
This project is still on-going
